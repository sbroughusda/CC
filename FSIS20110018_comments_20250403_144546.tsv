FSIS-2011-0018-0003	Comment from Valerie Pearce	I am writing a comment in dissent of the proposition to remove sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid from the prohibited list of additives to meat and poultry products. As a potential consumer of harmful additives, I find the evidence submitted by Kraft Foods and Kemin Food Technologies is insufficient in proving that all three agents are safe to use in meat and poultry products. brspan style='padding-left: 30px'spanMy opinion is based on the evidence that Kemin has relied on to prove the safe use of sodium benzoate and benzoic acid. The 1984 confirmation by the FDA was in regards to a 1973 study conducted by SCOGS. The 1973 study is antiquated research and new research must be performed to ensure the safety of benzoic acid for public use.brspan style='padding-left: 30px'spanIn addition, I noted a point of concern in the petition drawn by Kraft Foods. On page nine of the petition, Kraft stated that they used Lem-O-Fos in their meat and poultry products to &ldquo;enhance antimicrobial activity.&rdquo; They provided that Lem-O-Fos is 15% lemon juice concentrate. Lemon juice contains high sources of citric acid. Studies have shown that when benzoic acid is mixed with citric acid, it forms benzene, which is a carcinogen. Considering this, evaluation of procedures must be done to confirm the substances are either kept separate from one another or concrete evidence must prove that the mixture does not constitute a hazard to consumers.brspan style='padding-left: 30px'spanSince we are discussing substances that have the potential to cause significant harm, it would be irresponsible to depend on insufficient or outdated research when making such an impactful decision. To conclude, considering this proposed rule is in effort to make healthier, low sodium meat products, it would be wise to make certain a new risk to one&rsquo;s health is not being introduced in the process. br	2012-05-25T04:00:00Z	Public Submission	FALSE	FALSE
FSIS-2011-0018-0002	Comment from Benjamin Mudgett	span style='padding-left: 30px'spanListeria continues to be a concern public health and the food industry. The proposal to remove sodium benzoate, sodium propionate and benzoic acid from the prohibited substances used in meat and poultry is a safe and cost effective approach at inhibiting the growth of listeria in ready to eat meats. These substances are already used in foods and beverages including juice drinks, soda, pickles, and other snacks. brspan style='padding-left: 30px'spanThese preservatives have antimicrobial properties that inhibit the growth of listeria and will help protect the public from potential outbreaks. The risks listeria poses to pregnant women and unborn children is too great to ignore. It would be foolish to not approve such cost effective methods that have proven to not jeopardize the health and wellbeing of the public.span style='padding-left: 30px'spanFurthermore, the data collected has sufficiently proven that meat and poultry products nutrition content is not changed and its quality is protected. The rejection of this rule will not only put the public at risk of further listeria outbreaks, but will further increase the cost of business for the meat industry. These costs will inevitably be passed to the consumer. In today&rsquo;s economy, the consumer cannot afford the monetary cost and health risks associated with rejecting this proposed rule.br	2012-05-25T04:00:00Z	Public Submission	FALSE	FALSE
FSIS-2011-0018-0004	Comment from Vittorio Iosue	I oppose this because the three chemicals indicated in this Document are proven through empirical science to be harmful to human health. Allowing these additives to be used in the production of Meat and Poultry products will only increase the amounts citizens are exposed to and as a consequence will harm the public&#39;s health. Although these chemicals offer practical use, the cons outweigh the pros and therefore this Rule must be scraped.	2012-05-25T04:00:00Z	Public Submission	FALSE	FALSE
FSIS-2011-0018-0005	Comment from Richard Stillwagon	See attached file(s)brbrspan style='padding-left: 30px'spanIn response to the proposed rule 9 CFR Part 424 (Docket No. FSIS-2011-0018) concerning The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) proposal to remove sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid from the list of substances that the regulations prohibit for use in meat or poultry products. I am concerned about the accumulative effects of these products on children.brspan style='padding-left: 30px'spanWhile researching the proposed rule change I came across an article with Dr. Piper&rsquo;s research out of the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom, concerning the effects of sodium benzoate on cell mitochondria in yeast products. My secondary concern is about the question that has been raised concerning the effects of this product on children. It appears odd the Coca Cola Company would be removing this product from the Diet Coke beverage line while at a similar time Kraft Foods and Kemin Foods are adding it to theirs. My concern is not in the singular effects of these products on children but the accumulative effects of combined dosages. Parents may be unaware their children are consuming multiple doses of these products in soda, cheese products, hot dogs, ham, and fruit juices.brspan style='padding-left: 30px'spanI have been unable to find a study that shows data concerning this issue and wanted to raise the question of the validity that multiple doses by multiple products may exceed safety standards. With the long historical uses of sodium benzoate dating back to 1909 I feel confident in its positive use as a preservative however, as a parent, I am still concerned about the health of our youth in the United States of America.brThank you for your attention to this issue and the opportunity to comment on this rule.brSincerely, brbrRichard H.

FSIS-2011-0018-0008	Comment from Barbara Gatewood	This comment is posted pursuant to the proposed rule, listed as follows: brRule 9 CFR Part 424br[Docket No. FSIS-2011-0018]brRIN 0583-AD47brThis is to inform all interested parties of my objection to the proposed rule on the basis that I believe the food additives, sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid, should continue to be prohibited. I base this belief on the fact that numerous sources have found a plausible link that provides evidence that these substances cause cancer in humans. I as a consumer understand the value that the food industry places on these food additives and their desire to use them in the mass production of meat and poultry products. However, I would much rather pay more to ensure that my family and I consume only healthy food without said additives. To that end, I would appreciate it if this Rule to loosen the restrictions on these additives were denied.brbrRespectfully,brbrBarbara A.Gatewoodbr	2012-06-01T04:00:00Z	Public Submission	FALSE	FALSE
FSIS-2011-0018-0006	Comment from Diana Scott	I am opposed to expanding the use of sodium benzoate until newer research is examined into its safety. I think sodium benzoate needs to be re-investigated to see if it should still be considered GRAS. The FDA found Sodium Benzoate as a food preservative Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in 1973 based on available scientific literature from 1920 to 1972 (Food and Drug Administration, 1973; National Technology Information Service 1973). This data is based primarily on studies of LD50 (median lethal dose) in rats and consumer diets at the time. In the last 39 years technology and consumer diets have changed. Our understanding of cellular microbiology has advanced through technological advancements in areas such as light microscopy, fluorescently labeled proteins, more sensitive cameras, mathematical modeling, and mass spectrometry. Information technology has created a profound shift in the ability to review the most recent raw data research from around the world, and do metadata analysis. (Nature Cell Biology, 2009). In 1973 the main goals of research on sodium benzoate were: how much will kill humans, is it carcinogenic or teratogenic? Today the questions must include nanobiotoxicology, cytotoxicity, exogenous DNA damage, mutagens, epigenetics, accumulation exposure and delayed health effects, effects on children and vulnerable populations, and combination versus pure substance toxicology. Europe Questions Safety of Sodium Benzoate and Other Food Additives In 2006 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [was] asked to review the food additives currently permitted within the EU in order to determine whether full re-evaluation is required (Committee on Toxicity, 2006). The Committee on Toxicity specifically looked at the exiting data on sodium benzoate and determined that the structure of sodium benzoate suggests that it could penetrate the blood brain barrier or cross the placenta Neurotoxicity was not specifically investigated in any studies considered in the JECFA [Joint FAOWHO Expert Committee on Food Additives] or SCF [Scientific Committee on Food] (2006). In 2008 following the Southampton study by Jim Stevenson on hyperactivity in children given food color and sodium benzoate mixtures the Committee on Toxicity contacted food manufactures and consumers, then recommended that the food colors should be phased out because they were there for aesthetic reasons only, but they could not distinguish what effect was due specifically from sodium benzoate, and alternative preservatives may not be as effective. In 2012 the European Food Safety Authority decided all food additives permitted in the EU before 20 January 2009 will be subject to a new risk assessment... They called for researchers to submit published and unpublished research on the subject with information to include toxicokinetic and toxicity data (acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity; carcinogenicity; genotoxicity; reproduction and developmental toxicity; allergenicity, etc.) and any other information relevant to their safety assessment. Deadline for this research is August 15th, 2012. The researchers are asked whether they are willing to have their data shared with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Joint FAOWHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). Mitochondrial Damage A molecular biologist, Peter Piper, of Sheffield University in England found sodium benzoate may damage the DNA within cell mitochondria to the point of totally inactivating it, and depriving the cells ability to consume oxygen and produce energy. Many diseases are now being linked to mitochondrial DNA damage including Parkinsons and neurodegenerative diseases. (Hope, 2007) Children with autism are far more likely to have deficits in their ability to produce cellular energy than are typically developing children, a new study by researchers at UC Davis has found. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), found that cumulative damage and oxidative stress in mitochondria, the cell's energy producer, could influence both the onset and severity of autism, suggesting a strong link between autism and mitochondrial defects. (Science Daily, 2010) In their study Giulivi et al. found children with autism were more likely to have mitochondrial dysfunction, mtDNA overreplication, and mtDNA deletions than typically developing children (2010) A study in Molecular Psychiatry examined research into Autism Spectrum Disorders from 1977 to 2010 and found a large percentage of publications implicated an association between ASD and immune dysregulationinflammation (416 out of 437 publications, 95%), oxidative stress (all 115), mitochondrial dysfunction (145 of 153, 95%) and toxicant exposures (170 of 190, 89%). (Rossignol and Frye, 2012). Marazziti et al. also did a review of available literature and found a relationship between mitrochondrial disorders and schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, ADHD and Alzheimers dementia (2012). Sodium Benzoate toxic to Trypsin Trypsin is a proenzyme produced by the pancreas in the digestive system where it hydrolyses proteins. A 2012 study published in the British Journal of Nutrition using fluorescence spectroscopy, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy found that Sodium benzoate could unfold trypsin by decreasing the β-sheet structure and changed the internal microenvironment of the molecule causing toxic effects on the organism. (Mu, Lin and Lui, 2012). Connection to obesity A 2012 study found that Sodium Benzoate and several other food additives effect adipocytes (fat cells) decreasing leptin secretion. Leptin is a hormone that has a role in appetite and metabolism, and acts on receptors in the hypothalamus as an appetite suppressant. By decreasing circulating leptin Sodium Benzoate may contribute to obesity. (Ciardi et al., 2012) Genotoxicity A 2012 study of human lymphocytes found that Sodium Benzoate was clastogenic [breaks chromosomes], mutagenic and cytotoxic (Zengin, Yuzbasioglu, Unal, Yilmaz, & Aksoy, 2012) The lowest concentration used in this study was 6.25 micrograms per milliliter which is less than three times the acceptable limit in food. Dietary Trends Dietary trends in the United States show an average increase in calorie consumption between 1970 and 2011 of 425 more calories daily and of those calories only dairy products declined (USDA Economic Research Service, 2011). Soda consumption has replaced milk for many children and adults. In a meta-analysis of 88 studies, [the authors] examined the association between soft drink consumption and nutrition and health outcomes. [They] found clear associations of soft drink intake with increased energy intake and body weight. Soft drink intake also was associated with lower intakes of milk, calcium, and other nutrients and with an increased risk of several medical problems (e.g., diabetes) studies funded by the food industry reported significantly smaller effects than did nonindustry-funded studies. (Virtanen, Schwartz, and Brownell, 2006). Sodium Benzoate is the preservative most often used in soft drinks. Summary I realize sodium benzoate is effective against L. monocytogenes and other pathogens in food. But I think the newest research questions it safety in humans. I dont think expanding its use is a good idea until a safety assessment is done. The European Union is in the process of reviewing its safety now. References: Committee on Toxicity.

FSIS-2011-0018-0007	Comment from jean public	re sodium benzoate, propionate and benzoic - all preservatives - i do not believe this use is safe. i do believe it shoudl not be allowed. the food profiteers are pushing all kinds of chemicals on our food. they end up inour bodies and kill us. this needs to be banned. fdafsis seems to be &quot;owned&quot; by the food profiteers. the public wants all information on the alleged &quot;trials&quot; put on line and released to us. the public believes our federal agencies are skewing the public with unsafe food. if added to any food, they should be labelled as being used. fda so often doesnt want consumes to know what goes on with our food. did the industry execs at kraft or kemin eat food with this crap on it for sx months to prove safety in the body? i see no tests involving the human body after eating these chemicals - why is that? why did fda and fsis neglect that information. after all this is a food product and ends up n people&#39;s bodies. why would you avoid investigatin the human body. the tets you have accepted are completely ineffective in predicting safety. no tests of the human body afte ringestion were done. fatal flaw shows up. ban these chemicals.	2012-06-01T04:00:00Z	Public Submission	FALSE	FALSE
FSIS-2011-0018-0009	Comment from Brian Borchert	Sara Lee Corporation 3500 Lacey Road Downers Grove, IL 60515 -5424 -1.630.598.6000 June 12 , 2012 Docket Clerk U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safet y and Inspection Service Office of Policy and Program Development Patriots Plaza 3 1400 I ndependence Ave SW Mailstop 3782,8 -163A Washington, DC 20250 -3700 RE: Docket Number FSIS -2011-0018 Based in Downers Grove, I llinois, Sara Lee Corporation develops and markets many of the worlds favorite high -quality baked goods, packaged meats and coffee. L eading brands and products include Sara Lee frozen desserts and deli meats, Hillshire Farm lunch meats, Jimmy Dean sausage and breakfast foods, and Ball Park franks. As a leading manufacture of premium bakery andmeat items, Sara Lee Corporation conducts business under the regulatory oversight of both the U.S. Department of Agricultures Food S afety and Inspection Service (FSI S) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In total, Sara Lee Corporation operates 11production facilities and five distribution centers under FSI S inspection. Sara Lee Corporation is committed to providing safe and wholesome foods that are innovative and delight customers, while meeting their expectations for convenience and health. Sara Lee Corporation has long supported science -based regulation that is transparent to all stakeholders . Sara Lee Corporation submits the following comments on the proposed rule to remove sodium benzoate, sodium propionate and benzoic acid from the list of substances that the regulation prohibit for use in meat and poultry products. Specificall y we will comment on sodium propionate. Sara Lee submitted a request for waiver to use sodium propionate on February 2011. In addition a petition proposing toexpand the list of antimicrobial agents allowed in meat and poultry products to include sodium propionate was submitted in April 2011 . Research conducted b y Sara Lee has shown that sodium propionate is an effective antimicrobial that inhibit sthe growth of Listeria monocytogenes in read y to eat meat and poultry . Usage levels are lower than other antimicrobials, resulting in significant sodiu m reduction. 2To control Listeria monocytogenes growth in Ready to Eat Meats under Alternative 2, as defined in the Compliance Guidelines to Control Listeria monocytogenes in Post -Lethality Exposed Ready -to-Eat Meat and Poultry Products, an establishment applies either a post - lethality treatment or an antimicrobial agent or process. The antimicrobial is added to ensure inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes for the refrigerated shelf life of the product. Multiple studies were completed to show the effective ness of sodium propionate at inhibiting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes on read y to eat cooked meat and poultry items, including sliced ham, sliced turkey breast , cooked poultry breakfast sausage and cooked pork breakfast sausage. The studies showed t hat sodium propionate was as effective as the current antimicrobial s.In most cases levels of 0.3% were effective at inhibiting L isteria growth for the shelf life of the product. For turkey breakfast sausage levels of 0. 4% were most effective . Safety Sodium propionate is affirmed GRAS by FDA (21CFR184.1784). Allowed uses include many food items such as, baked goods, non -alcoholic beverages, and cheese. While not currentl y allowed in meat and poultry b y FSIS, sodium propionate is listed as GRAS for the use in meat. Therefore, we would assert that there is no adverse affects in meat or poultry products by use of this compound at the proposed levels. There will be no impact on FSI S or establishment employ ee safet y. A copy of the Material Safet y Data sheet was submitted with both Sara Lees request for waiver and petition . Further, this compound is very similar in nature to current antimicrobials employ ed at the meat and poultry establishment and will replace this technology . Specificall y, the sodium propio nate would be an alternate to current antimicrobial s. Sara Lee research has confirmed that sodium propionate is suitable for use as an antimicrobial agent in controlling Listeria monocytogenes in read y-to-eat meat and poultry products. Sodium propionate does not mask spoilage, does not negativel y affect sensory attributes, and provides the benefit of significantly lowering sodium while maintaining safet y. Reduction in sodium is due to the substantially lower usage levels of sodium propionate compared to the current antimicrobial blend. Effective antimicrobial agent for ready -to-eat meat and poultry products Sara Lee conducted Listeria monocytogenes challenge stud y with the University of Wisconsin to confirm that sodium propionate is effective for use i n processed meat and poultry as an anti -Listeria control agent ( Included in original waiver request and petition) . A commerciall y available dry sodium propionate was used at 0.3% and 0.4% levels in ham and cured turkey . The antimicrobial efficacy of sodium propionate was then compared to that of the current industry standard level of sodium lactate and sodium diacetate blend. The study showed that both 0.3% and 0.4% of sodium propionate inhibited Listeria monocytogenes growth in both products as effectivel yor more effectivel y than a sodium lactate and sodium diacetate blend. 3To determine the minimal effective level of sodium propionate in inhibiting Listeria growth in turkey , Sara Lee conducted an additional challenge stud y. The study confirmed that 0.2 5% of sodium propionate effectively suppressed Listeria monocytogenes growth in cured turkey breast (Included in original waiver request and petition) . As a reference, preliminary research conducted by Sara Lee with cured turkey demonstrated that 0.2% of sodium propionate inhibited growth of Listeria monocytogenes through 6 weeks and then, supported 1 -log increase at 4oC (Included in original waiver request and petition) . In the same stud y, Sara Lee also tested uncured turkey breast formulated without sodium nitrite to confirm that sodium propionate is an effective antimicrobial in uncured products. Lactate salts are known to be less effective in controlling Listeria growth in products manufactured without nitrite than in cured products. Therefore, unc ured meat and poultry products are usually produced with higher levels of lactate salts than cured products. In this study , sodium propionate inhibited growth of Listeria monocytogenes for 9 weeks and 12 weeks at levels of 0.25% and 0.3%, respectively . This study confirmed that sodium propionate is an effective antimicrobial agent in both cured and uncured turkey breast. To validate the efficacy of sodium propionate in additional meat categories, uncured pork breakfast sausage links were tested in ano ther Listeria monocytogenes challenge study (Included in original waiver request and petition ). This study confirmed that sodium propionate inhibited Listeria monocytogenes growth through at least 8 weeks when added at levels of 0.2% and 15 weeks with 0.3 % sodium propionate. A study completed more recentl y on uncured turkey breakfast sausage show that levels above 0.3% were need edto inhibit Listeria monocytogenes for the entire shelf life of the product. Challenge studies conducted by Sara Lee and the U niversity of Wisconsin confirmed that sodium propionate is effective in inhibiting Listeria monocytogenes growth in cured and uncured meat and poultry products at substantially lower usage levels than the current industry standard levels of a sodium lactat eandsodium diacetate blend. By replacing the blend of lactate salts and sodium diacetate with sodium propionate, the level of chemical preservatives in read y-to-eat meat and poultry products will decrease. A usage level of 0.34% was need to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes for the entire shelf life of the product Effects on sensory attributes Sara Lee conducted central location consumer tests (CL T) to confirm that meat and poultry products made with sodium propionate are acceptable in terms of flavor, aftertaste, and other organoleptic attributes. Separate batches of turkey breast and ham samples were produced under good manufacturing practice at the Sara Lee R&D facility using a sodium lactate andsodium diacetate blend or sodium propionate. The res ult included in the petition from consumer tests showed that consumer liking of turkey breast 4and ham was not affected by the replacement of the sodium lactate and sodium diacetate blend wi th sodium propionate .Ongoing monitoring of consumer complaints of products produced under the waiver ha sshown no complaints directly related to sodium propionate. Effects on nutritional composition To confirm the effects of sodium propionate on nutritional composition, turkey breast samples made with sodium propionat e were analyzed for cholesterol, sodium, calc ium, iron and sugars . Samples with the current antimicrobial blend were also analy zed. The proposed usage level of sodium propionate substantially lowered the sodium content in products by replacing the sodium lactate and sodium diacetate blend. The sodium level in turkey breast made with 0.3% of sodium propionate was reduced by 24% when compared to turkey breast made with sodium lactate andsodium diacetate. There were no significant differences in nutrition al values other than sodium. In uncured turkey sausage using 0.4% sodium propionate, sodium was reduced b y 35%. Proximate analy sis showed similar fat, protein and sodium chloride contents between products with sodium propionate and products with a sodium lactate andsodium diacetate blend . Moisture increase in propionate products was observed due to lactate solids being replaced b y water. Conclusion Sara Lee supports FSIS proposal to change 9CFR424.23 allowing for the use of sodium propionate in read yto eat meat and poultry products. Sara Lee asks that sodium propionate be added as a safe and suitable antimicrobial agent with usage levels up to 0.4% when a producer follows good manufacturing practices and properl y labels the sodium propionate in the i ngredient statement on the product.

FSIS-2011-0018-0012	Comment from Marisa Dyson	1 MEMORANDUM To: Docket Clerk USDA, FSIS, OPPD From: Marisa Dyson Docket Number: 2011-0018 Date: Jun 24, 2012 Re: Proposed Food Ingredients and Sources of Radiation Listed on Approved for Use in the Production of Meat and Poultry Products Rule. Question Presented Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 301), the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601), and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451), have the FDA and the FSIS fulfilled their responsibility for determining the safety of the use of sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid in the use of meat and poultry when they have neglected to discuss recent findings of the carcinogenic nature of these substances when used in combination with vitamin C? In light of these issues are the FDA and FSIS expectations that these amendments will incur no associated costs with this proposed rule realistic given the recent litigation surrounding similar additives in carbonated beverages such as Coca-Cola products? Finally, if litigated will the FDA and FSIS be able to prove that they are based on fair evaluation of the entire record to meet the burden of proof required for judicial review? Short Answer No. The FDA and the FSIS have failed to evaluate the entire record because they have failed to adequately consider the carcinogenic nature of these additives and the associated costs. Statement of Facts Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 301) the FDA is responsible for determining the safety of ingredients in meat and poultry; and under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451) the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for determining the suitability of FDA approved substances in meat and poultry products. Since January 2000, the FDA and FSIS have agreed to work together to evaluate petitions requesting the approval of new substance or new uses of previously approved substances for use in or on meat and poultry products. Under 9 CFR 424.23(a) sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid have all been prohibited for use in meat and poultry because they can have the effect of concealing damage or inferiority or making the product appear better or of greater value than it actually is. In January of 2007 Kraft Foods Global, Inc. (Kraft) petitioned FSIS to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to permit the use of sodium benzoate and sodium propionate as acceptable antimicrobial agents that may be used in combination with other approved ingredients to inhibit the growth of Listeria monocytogens (Lm) in ready-to-eat 2 (RTE) meat and poultry products. In July of 2010 Kemin Food Technologies (Kemin) petitioned FSIS to amend the regulations to permit the use of liquid sodium propionate and liquid sodium benzoate as acceptable antimicrobial agents in meat and poultry products. After being given permission to conduct trials Kraft and Kemin were found by the FSIS to have gathered sufficient data to support the use of sodium propionate, sodium benzoate, and benzoic acid as antimicrobial agents in RTE meat and poultry products. As a result FSIS is proposing to remove these substances from the list of those prohibited for use in meat or poultry products, and should this rule be finalized these substances will be moved to the approved list of additive for RTE meat and poultry. Discussion In order to determine if the FDA and FSIS will be able to prove that moving these substances onto the list of approved additives is based on a fair evaluation of the entire record the first issue that must be addressed is whether or not Lm posses a serious health threat and, if so, if these substances are in fact effective in decreasing the incidence of this bacteria in RTE meats and poultry. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 persons become seriously ill with listeriosis each year. Of these, 260 die.1 Pregnant women, newborn babies, persons with weakened immune systems, persons with cancer, diabetes, alcoholism, liver or kidney disease, persons with AIDS, and the elderly are at increased risk for contracting Lm and suffering major complications or death from it, while healthy children and adults occasionally get infected with Lm, but rarely become seriously ill.2 The primary way people become infected with Lm is through consumption of contaminated food. Lm can be found in a variety of foods including LTE meats and poultry. While Lm is killed by pasteurization and cooking in some ready-to-eat foods, such as hot dogs and deli meats, contamination may occur after factory cooking but before packaging. Unlike most bacteria, Listeria can grow and multiply in some foods in the refrigerator.3 However, proper food storage, handling, and preparation can dramatically decrease the risk of listeriosis, and those at high risk of listeriosis complications should be advised to avoid foods that are likely to carry this bacteria altogether. In trials conducted by Kraft and Kemin the use of sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid in RTE meats and poultry did decrease the rate of growth of Lm, but usually only after about 6-8 weeks of storage time at four degrees Celsius. This can be seen in the following four tables taken from the study conducted by Kraft:4 1 Center for Disease Control, http:www.cdc.govlisteriarisk.html (last visited June 28, 2012). 2 Id. 3 Center for Disease Control, http:www.cdc.govlisteriacauses.html (last visited June 28, 2012). 4 Petition for Rulemaking to Allow Sodium Benzoate and Sodium Propionate as Antimicrobial Agents in Meat and Poultry Products, January 19, 2007, pages 50-54. 3 4 Therefore, while Lm does affect a significant number of people, while its effects can be serious and even fatal, while it is often found in RTE meats and poultry, and while sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid does decrease the rate of Lm in these foods the effect is not significant until after 4-6 weeks of storage. Additionally, other means of decreasing the incidence of listeriosis, such as proper handling and storage of foods, or abstinence from high risk foods for certain segments of the population may be a more effective means of decreasing the incidence of listeriosis. The next issue to be considered in determining if the FDA and FSIS will be able to prove that moving these substances onto the list of approved additives is based on a fair evaluation of the entire record is whether they are safe for human consumption. The studies performed by Kraft and Kemin focus on whether or not these additives mask defects or spoilage of RTE meats and poultry, however fail to discuss if these additive are safe for human consumption in the first place. This assumption is based on the fact that sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid have been categorized as Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) by the FDA. However, the FDA came to this conclusion in 1973. In the past 39 years since the FDA categorized these additives as GRAS technology has advanced and knowledge of food additives has grown. In particular research on Sodium Benzoate has revealed that when mixed with vitamin C the two react and form Benzene, which has been found to be carcinogenic and has been linked to leukemia in particular.5 In fact In the early 1990s the FDA had urged companies not to use benzoate in products that also contain ascorbic acid, but in the 2000s companies were still using that combination. A lawsuit filed in 2006 by private attorneys ultimately forced Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and other soft-drink makers in the U.S. to reformulate affected beverages, typically fruit-flavored products.6 Soft-drink makers are now eliminating the use of benzoate in combination with vitamin C worldwide.7 These facts should cause the FDA and FSIS to pause and consider if benzoate should continue to be classified as GRAS. Furthermore, Kraft asserts in its own research that it will use benzoate in combination with lemon juice after this proposed regulation is passed.8 This would only replicate the carcinogenic effects found in soft-drinks which, as previously discussed, has just been through litigation. Under executive Orders 13563 and 12866 agencies are given the responsibility of assessing all costs and benefits of proposed regulations and to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits, including potential economic, environmental, and public health and safety. The FSIS claims in this proposed rule that there are no expected costs associated with this proposed ruleCompany costs and the agencies costs associated with these evaluations will not be effected by this proposed rule should it become final. However, this fails to consider two costs which will be highly likely if this rule does become final: 1) the possible cost to public health when food additives, which are known to be carcinogenic, are added to RTE meat and poultry and 2) the probable economic cost of litigation similar to that which was faced 5 Center for Disease Control, http:www.bt.cdc.govagentbenzenebasicsfacts.asp (last visited June 28, 2012). 6 Center for Science in the Public Interest, http:www.cspinet.orgreportschemcuisine.htm#sodiumb (last visited June 28, 2012). 7 International Council of Beverages Associations ICBA Guidance Document to Mitigate the Potential for Benzene Formation in Beverages 8 Petition for Rulemaking to Allow Sodium Benzoate and Sodium Propionate as Antimicrobial Agents in Meat and Poultry Products, January 19, 2007, page 54. 5 by soft-drink companies for creating a product that was linked to cancers such as leukemia. Therefore, the claim that there are no expected costs should be regarded as unfounded. Furthermore, if this proposed rule were to be subject to judicial review it would likely not meet the burden of proof required by the courts. When considering the safety of food additives the standard of review is not the typical substantial evidence standard, but rather the courts require that such findings be sustained only if based upon a fair evaluation of the entire record.9 The rationale for this new standard has been explained as: The findings of fact and orders made by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare should not be based upon isolated evidence in the record, which evidence in and of itself might be considered substantial without taking account of contradictory evidence of possibly equal or even greater substancethe appearance before a House subcommittee of a panel of outstanding scientists, the subcommittee expressed itself as impressed with the wide range of scientific judgment factors which are involved in determining the safety of a food additive, and that considering the eminent qualifications of all the scientists and experts who participated in these panel hearings, the scientific testimony of any one of the participants would have to be considered as substantial evidence, but that any conclusions based solely upon the scientific judgment of any one of the participants without taking account of contradictory scientific views expressed by other participants could not be considered conclusions based upon a fair evaluation of the entire record.10 In this case the FSIS has based is decision of allowing the use of sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid as an additive in RTE meats and poultry primarily on evidence that these substances will not mask or disguise spoilage or defects, but have failed to take other issues into consideration, such as the carcinogenic nature of these additives, the cost of likely litigation, and the existence of better alternatives to confronting the problem of Lm contamination in these types of foods. Thus, the FSIS really has not based its findings upon a fair evaluation of the entire record, and probably would not pass judicial scrutiny if a court were to review this new rule. Conclusion The FDA and the FSIS have likely not fulfilled their responsibility for determining the safety of the use of sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid in the use of meat and poultry because they have neglected to discuss recent findings of the carcinogenic nature of these substances when used in combination with vitamin C. As a result of this the FDA and FSIS will likely incur both economic costs and costs to the health and welfare of society. Finally, if litigated the FDA and FSIS most likely will not be able to prove that their findings have been based on fair evaluation of the entire record, and will thus fail to meet the burden of proof required for judicial review. I therefore urge the FDA and FSIS to more carefully investigate the carcinogenic nature of these additives and work to ensure that carcinogenic chemical reactions, such as those found to occur in soft-drinks, will not be present in RTE meats and poultry; or in 9 Continental Chemiste Corp. v Ruckelshaus (1972, CA7) 461 F2d 331. 10 21 A.L.R.

Reg. 26706 (May 7, 2012) RFA supports the Proposed Rule to remove sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid from the list of substances that the regulations prohibit for use in meat or poultry products. RFA is a non- profit trade association of manufacturers and suppliers of refrigerated prepared foods united by a common interest: to advance and safeguard the industry. Members include manufacturers and suppliers of wet salads, refrigerated entrees, side dishes, dips, desserts, and s oups, as well as companies engaged in business operations related to the refrigerated foods industry. The RFA develops programs to enhance and promote food safety, strengthens the operating practices of its member companies, and fosters a networked community to share information. RFA has reviewed the separate petitions submitted by Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and Kemin Food Technologies, submitted in January of 2007 and July of 2010, respectively. The petitions present data gathered by the two companies col lected during their use of the ingredients under waivers approved by FSIS. Both petitions present evidence indicating the additives are effective as anti -listerial agents and are suitable for specified uses in meat and poultry products. Specifically, data were presented by Kraft regarding Page 2 of 2 use of sodium benzoate and sodium propionate in RTE meat and poultry products, specifically hot dogs, ham, and turkey. Kemin submitted data regarding use of sodium propionate alone and with benzoic acid use in cured turkey and cooked chicken breast. RFA finds the information presented in these two petitions persuasive and, based on those data, urges FSIS to promptly make final its Proposed Rule. Many RFA members have experience using sodium benzoate and regard it as an effective anti- microbial agent in appropriate uses, including in mayonnaise- based seafood salads, such as tuna salad. Approval of this Proposed Rule would encourage research to demonstrate suitability of sodium benzoate as an ant i-microbial agent in mayonnaise- based meat and poultry salads. If FSIS determines that such research demonstrates that sodium benzoate is suitable for that and other applications, an additional anti -microbial agent will be available to help ensure the safety of meat and poult ry products . Accordingly, RFA supports the Proposed R ule. Further, RFA respectfully urges FSIS to promptly make the subject r ule final because sodium benzoate promises to serve as an effective means of inhibiting growth of Listeria monocytogenes, which t he Center for Disease Control regards as an important public health problem in the United States.  RFA recommends that FSIS act as expeditiously as possible to advance this initiative, which holds significant promise for enhancing the safety of the Ameri can food supply.

FSIS-2011-0018-0014	Comment from Katherine Simone	June 29, 2012 Food Safety and Inspection Service Department of Agriculture Docket No. FSIS-2011-0018 Re: Proposed Legislation: Food Ingredients and Sources of Radiation Listed and Approved for Use in the Production of Meat and Poultry Products To Whom It May Concern: Meats and poultry are widely consumed products that run the risk of carrying disease. Thus, inevitably, the presence of preservatives has become more commonplace among manufacturers to ensure that the products consumers pick up off the shelves are as sanitary as possible and have had no drastic change in quality. These preservatives serve important functions in keeping food products ripe and ready to be consumed and they have been proven to be harmless when used at the low levels proposed by this legislation. The three preservatives at issue in this proposed legislation are no different. Therefore, I support the Food Safety and Inspection Services (FSIS) proposed legislation to remove Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Propionate, and Benzoic Acid from the list of substances that the regulations prohibit for use in meat or poultry products. However, I suggest completion of more studies surrounding the effects of these preservatives in higher dosages, possible allergic reactions through contact or ingestion and the extent of those reactions, and potential alternatives that produce the same outcome without the use of preservatives, among other things. It is not surprising that a number of consumers do not like the idea of manufacturing preservatives into the foods they eat and serve to others. Accordingly, the purchase of organic foods has increased substantially as consumers try to avoid preservatives like pesticides and preservatives. However, studies have shown that, when used in appropriate amounts, the effects of Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Propionate, and Benzoic Acid carry benefits rather than the costs they are often thought to cause. Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Propionate, and Benzoic Acid are all used as preservatives or additives, among other things, and are effective in reducing or slowing down certain molds and bacteria found in meat and poultry products. In fact, all three preservatives are not only found in manufactured foods and products but are also found naturally in non-processed food (i.e. certain vegetables, cranberries, cinnamon, and dairy products, to name a few) as well as in animals. When used in the manufacturing process, these preservatives are effective at inhibiting the growth of certain molds and bacteria that inevitably develop in foods and cause food to go bad, also known as spoilage. One of the bacteria of specific concern is Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). It is a known bacterial human pathogen that develops in both raw and cooked meats as well as poultry. While a common consumer belief is that ingestion of preservatives is brings with it harmful health risks, the reality is that use of these preservatives is an effective way of reducing the levels of Lm in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products and actually making them safer for consumers rather than more harmful. The reduction of spoilage by these preservatives brings with it an insurmountable economic benefit for both manufacturers and consumers: low prices. Without preservatives, spoilage occurs faster, causing quality and shelf life to decrease. Consumers dont want to buy meat or poultry that isnt within the narrow range of colors, smells, and textures that they are used to and expect. Without preservatives, the price of these products would increase because they would spoil sooner. This would not only hurt consumers in an already depression-laden economy, but would likewise hurt manufacturers and sellers through high production costs since they would need to restock the shelves more often. This is one benefit that does not apply to organic foods. Organic foods are undeniably more expensive because they dont have the longer sell-by dates that foods with preservatives have. Another benefit to the specific preservatives in this proposed legislation is their lack of a harmful effect on the environment. As stated above, these preservatives already exist naturally in certain foods, trees, and animals and they are found in our rain and drinking water, among other things. Their release back into the environment is not likely, if not at all, to cause harm to the environment or to society. However, with benefits come costs. Consumers worries about effects of preservatives on health are not unusual and, in some cases, are not unfounded. Studies have found that benzoates, including Sodium Benzoate and Benzoic Acid, may cause allergic reactions such as hives and edema. It may also have effects on persons with asthma. These effects can range from a tight feeling in ones chest to a scratchy throat or a rash. However, these types of reactions are very rare and are not associated with benzoates in the amount proposed by this legislation. Outside of rare allergic reactions, these preservatives really do not have a negative effect on the human body. Both Sodium Benzoate and Benzoic Acid are rapidly metabolized and excreted so there is a low likelihood of accumulation and any harmful effects over time. Some studies show a risk to the persons dealing with the preservatives throughout the manufacturing process. Sodium Propionate has been known to cause irritation to skin and eyes when coming into direct contact with it. However, none of these risks require extensiveany medical attention as a remedy. The use of protective equipment such as goggles and gloves is adequate to prevent contact and subsequent irritation. One area of improvement within the proposed legislation is to build upon and improve public knowledge of these preservatives. Since the proposed legislation is dealing with food consumption, up-to-date studies and statistics about the effect these preservatives have on the food and its consumers will be necessary to track any changes overtime. Without this knowledge, and specifically without stressing the importance of only using these preservatives in appropriate amounts, there becomes a risk of manufacturers pushing for higher and higher amounts of each preservative or of new preservatives. This temptation comes from multiple sources. One source is the benefits offered by these preservatives. The amount of a preservative in a food product is proportionate to the decrease in growth of harmful bacteria such as Lm. This reduced bacteria presence makes it tempting to use a larger amount of preservatives. However, while reducing the growth of Lm is beneficial to consumers, it is not necessarily ideal to do so by incorporating larger amounts of preservatives into the foods we consume. This is something to look out for. Finding alternative methods to decrease the presence of Lm without filling our food with preservatives is one way to prepare to combat this potential consequence in the future. A second source of potential pressure for higher levels of preservatives to be allowed in foods is consumers. As people become more comfortable with preservatives being used in meat and poultry products, and as fears about the associated health dangers disappear, acceptance of preservatives may even turn into preference. This preference, in turn, could produce a demand for use of higher amounts of the preservatives in food. Studies should continue to be run on exactly what amounts of each preservative, when consumed or even merely handled through the manufacturing process, can become potentially harmful to the diet of society. At what point can a preservative leave a trail in the human body and lead to disease andor health complications? The more answers available, the more control will be able to be exerted over companies and manufacturers who will likely be tempted to push the amount limit when these preservatives become commonplace in the meat and poultry industry and in other industries. While incorporating additional preservatives into the meat and poultry industry may not be currently accepted by all, a descriptive explanation of the exact properties, side effects, and related health hazards, or in this case, the lack thereof, will settle any concerns about consumption. In the big picture, these preservatives can be used in such small amounts that there are very rare health risks associated. The bigger risks, which are easily prevented, pertain to those handling the preservatives throughout the manufacturing process. As was discussed above, those risks are easily prevented and remedied. I support the FSISs proposed legislation to remove Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Propionate, and Benzoic Acid from the list of substances that the regulations prohibit for use in meat or poultry products.

As a life-science company, Kemin is dedicated to delivering scientifically sound, innovative ingredients that keep food safe and fresh for consumers. Kemin Industries submits the following comments on the proposed rule to remove sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, propionic acid and benzoic acid from the list of substances that the regulations prohibit for use in meat and poultry products. Specifically we will comment on sodium propionate and it active ingredient propionic acid. Propionic acid and its salts have been in use as ingredients of antimicrobial products since the 1950s. Kemin has been a leader in liquid sodium propionate technology used specifically in the tortilla market since the early 1990s. Sodium propionate is the salt form of propionic acid, which is an organic acid that is commonly used as a preservative in food and is naturally found in butter and cheese. It prevents growth of mold and some bacteria, thereby prolonging the shelf life of packaged baked goods.1 Sodium propionate and propionic acid are affirmed as GRAS for use as antimicrobials at GMP levels. Sodium propionate allowed uses include many food items such as baked goods, non-alcoholic beverages, and cheese. With Kemins years of experience and understanding of the liquid sodium propionate technology in tortillas as an effective antimicrobial, we recommend allowing this now for incorporation into meat and poultry products which are of high food safety concern. Kemin submitted a petition to FSIS in April 2010, proposing to expand the list of antimicrobial agents for use in meat and poultry products to include sodium propionate and propionate acid. Propionic acid and its salts provide another option to currently approved antimicrobials. Since 2000, the L. monocytogenes prevalence rate in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products has dropped 80 percent to less than one third of one percent.2 In 2005, the American Meat Institute funded research with the University of Wisconsin-Madison to identify additional antimicrobial options to control Listeria monocytogenes in high-risk, ready-to-eat cured and uncured meat and poultry products. This research verified that organic acids and their salts (propionate, benzoate, and sorbate) can enhance the safety of high-moisture, ready-to-eat cured and uncured meat and poultry products.2 Published data in the Journal of Applied Bacteriology confirmed that the relative inhibitory effect of organic acids was propionate  acetate  lactate  citrate. This study evaluated the effects of sodium propionate, acetate, lactate and citrate on cell proliferation, glucose and oxygen consumption, and ATP production in Listeria monocytogenes in growing and resting cells.3 Kemin decided to conduct additional research on cured ready-to-eat deli style turkey with the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This data has been included in the petition submitted to FSIS. In addition to the above mentioned third-party study, Kemin has completed multiple commercial studies to show the effectiveness of liquid sodium propionate at inhibiting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes on ready-to-eat cooked meat and poultry products including cured and uncured turkey, cured ham, sliced roast beef and hot dogs. All studies demonstrated that liquid sodium propionate is a consistently performing alternative to the currently used technologies. Kemins research has confirmed that liquid sodium propionate is suitable for use as an antimicrobial agent in controlling Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products. Sodium propionate does not mask spoilage, does not negatively affect sensory attributes, and provides the benefit of lowering sodium contribution in meat and poultry products, while extending shelf-life. The low sodium contribution will help those consumers watching their sodium intake. Conclusion Kemin Industries has proposed FSIS amend the rule to remove the provision that prohibits the use of sodium propionate and propionic acid in or on any meat product except as provided in 9 CFR Chapter III; and supports the addition of sodium propionate and propionic acid to FSIS directive 7120.1. Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen with potentially deadly consequences and Kemin believes that offering additional food safety options to meat and poultry manufacturers is vital. Based on studies conducted demonstrating consistent Listeria control, Kemin requests sodium propionate and propionic acid be added as safe and suitable antimicrobial agents with usage levels up to 0.5% in meat and poultry products.

Organized in 1946, NAMA represents the interests of meat packers and processors throughout the United States. With nearly 400 meat processing members throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico and beyond, NAMA has a vested interest in the FSIS Proposed Rule. NAMA is an advocate of the use of sound science in making food safety determinations. Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and Kemin Food Technologies were both able to demonstrate through sound science in their respective petitions that sodium benzoate, sodium propionate and benzoic acid provided an antimicrobial effect of controlling the growth of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), without concealing damage or masking inferiority. Further, the addition of these ingredients in products did not alter the nutritional composition of product when compared to untreated product. By finalizing the rule, NAMA agrees that consumers would benefit from the expedited approval of substances that enhance food safety in this instance by controlling the growth of Lm in RTE meat and poultry products. As data has been submitted, reviewed and accepted by FSIS for the use of sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid, under the conditions proposed in the petitions submitted, NAMA supports the removal of these substances from the list of substances that the regulations prohibit for use in meat or poultry products.

Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and Kemin Food Technologies, Inc. submitted petitions to FSIS requesting this action. Kraft Foods very much appreciates the agencys favorable response to our petition. The petitions provide a comprehensive analysis of the safety, effectiveness, and suitability of these substances as used in readytoeat (RTE) meat and poultry products. These comments incorporate the petitions by reference. In preparing these comments, we reviewed comments already submitted in response to the proposal and noted that some comments expressed concern about the safety of sodium benzoate when mixed with Vitamin C. As we explained to FSIS in advance of filing the Kraft Foods petition, the combination of benzoate and Vitamin C, when combined with a low pH, heat and light, has been found to produce low levels of benzene in certain beverage products. The conditions needed for benzene to form from benzoate are not present in RTE meats, which are close to neutral pH (6), continuously refrigerated, and protected from excessive exposure to light. Therefore, the proposed use of sodium benzoate in RTE meats does not present a safety concern, even if combined with Vitamin C or similar compounds. In summary, these substances provide manufacturers of RTE meat and poultry products with additional tools to help prevent foodborne illnesses by effectively and efficiently inhibiting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes , a goal Kraft Foods shares with FSIS. While protecting food safety, sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and benzoic acid also provide a unique opportunity to improve the nutrition profiles of meat and poultry products through the potential reduction of sodium levels. For these reasons, and on the grounds set out in the petitions, Kraft Foods urges FSIS to publish final rules consistent with the proposal as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued consideration. Respectfully submitted, Ann Mileur Boeckman Chief Counsel, Food Law	2012-07-09T04:00:00Z	Public Submission	TRUE	TRUE
FSIS-2011-0018-0021	Comment from Robin Peterson	I) urac ti re by naturi PURAC America, Inc 111 Barclay Boulevard Lincolnshire Corporate Center Lincolnshire. II 60069 USA July 26, 2012 Dr. William Shaw Mr. Doug Palo Director, RIMD U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) Patriots Plaza 3, Mail Stop 5271 355 E Street S.W. Washington, DC 20250 Docket Clerk U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) Office of Policy and Program Development (OPPD) Patriots Plaza 3 1400 Independence Avenue SW Mailstop 3782, 8-163A Washington, D.C. 20250-3700 Re: Comments regarding Food Ingredients and Sources of Radiation Listed and Approved for Use in the Production of Meat and Poultry Products Docket ID: FSIS-2011-0018 Dear Sirs: Please accept this late submission of comments in general support of the FSIS proposed rule to amend 9 C.F.R.  424.23(a)(3) to remove sodium propionate from the list of prohibited substances that the regulations prohibit for use in in various meat and poultry products. Specifically, Purac concurs with the FSIS conclusion that the use of sodium propionate as an antimicrobial in ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products is both safe and suitable. In response to FSIS request for public comments, Purac developed and tested two new antimicrobial formulations that contain sodium propionate: Protect SR 50 (liquid sodium propionate) and Opti.Form Pro P24 (potassium acetate, sodium propionate). Based on Purac's testing of these formulations, Purac respectfully requests that the FSIS listing for sodium propionate in Directive 7120.1 read as follows: Class of Substance Substance Purpose Product Amount **** Antimicrobial Agent Sodium Propionate To inhibit microbial growth Various RTE meat and poultry products Up to 0.5% (by wt of total formulation) when used alone or in combination with approved antimicrobial agents and adjuvants consistent w GMP The above described antimicrobial use of sodium propionate differs from the uses described by petitioners in three respects: 1.Elimination of the pH as part of the Substance description proposed by Kemin; and 2.Increased use level Amount as proposed by Kraft when used in combination with other antimicrobial ingredients 3.Addition of RTE in Product Elimination of pH: The pH of Protect SR 50 is 5.5-5.7 (vs. Kemin's pH 4.8-5.2). This higher pH provides several benefits: a)Allows for a better stability of the antimicrobial solution; b)Addresses concerns around the flashpoint during manufacture of the solution; c)Addresses concerns around shipping and handling classifications (corrosive) for low pH products; and d)Maximizes sensoryyield characteristics in finished meat products which degrade as formula pH decreases. The elimination of pH from the Directive listing will provide room for innovation and fair competition in the market. In addition, it is not needed in order to provide proper Listeria monocytogens (Lm) control. Increased Use Level Amount: Purac found that 0.26% propionate was needed when used in combination with acetate to prevent Lm growth for 120 days (attached) in a beef-pork low moisture hot dog. NYCDMS1096619.6 Kraft's petition evaluates combinations of propionate and the very powerful benzoate, hence requests a level of only 0.2% sodium propionate when used in combination with other antimicrobials. Our results indicate that when propionate is combined with commonly used existing antimicrobials for meat and poultry, such as lactate, acetate and diacetate, higher levels of sodium propionate will be needed, especially to ensure safety of uncured high moisture items. Addition of RTE: The petitions for approval have focused on the benefits of propionate in controlling listeria outgrowth in RTE meats. Enclosed for your review are Purac's Product Data Sheets, Product information brochures and Application reports including sensory analysis and listeria challenge study showing product specifications, use levels and Lm inhibition. Thank you for your consideration and please contact me with additional questions.

These levels were identified using an internal Purac Listeria control model 2.4 Analyses Hot Dogs pH The pH was measured in triplicate using flat membrane electrode. The pH of the samples was measured by cutting off 3 slices (2-3 cm thick) from the sausage and after this on the surface of the slices the pH was measured. Water activity The water activity of the cooked Hotdogs was determined using a Lab-Master-aw (Novasina, Switzerland) by placing approximately 5g portions of a meat slice into a plastic sample cup and inserted into the vapor chamber. Before the start of measurements a calibration cup of 0.98 was placed in order to check accuracy. Moisture and fat analyses Analyzed batches were Control, 3.5% Opti.Form PD4 and 1.0% Protect SR50. Target moisture was 60%. Analyses performed by AL control Laboratories located in Oosterhout (Netherlands). Not all batches were analyzed due to expense Sensory evaluation A descriptive comparison taste test was done with our internal meat panel. In this taste session we compared 3.5% Opti.Form PD4, 0.3% Protect SR50, 0.6% Protect SR50 and 1.0% Protect SR50. Page 4 of 9 Innovation Center Food Confidential - Not intended for customers purac The Hotdogs were pre-warmed and kept warm under aluminum foil until taste session was started. Batches tested on attributes salt, meat, bitter, sweet, sour and product properties firmness, juiciness. We also asked the panel to give their preference. Microbiological evaluation 2.3.1 Preparation of inocula 5 Listeria monocyrtogenes strains (limon 23-NCTC12480-serotype 4b, limon 32- NCIMB13449-serotype 12a, limon 39-LMG23193-serotype 12a, limon 43- NRRLB33028-serotype 12b) and limon 49-NRRLB33039-serotype 12c) were singly activated in BHI broth (24h at 37C) from frozen glycerol stock cultures. Activated working cultures were transferred again into BHI broth and incubated for 5d at 70C. After the cultures were grown separately, a cocktail of these 5 cultures was made and diluted into 0.1% peptone water to yield desired target level inoculation of 4 logs CFUg. 2.3.2 Product inoculation After storage each sausage was disinfected with ethanol (70%), before the casing was removed. The sausages were sliced into slices on a disinfected slicer (Berke!, model 824 DeLeede the Netherlands) in a laminar flow cabinet. Slices (n=4, in total 20 grampackage) from each batch of cooked sausage were placed in individual vacuum bags, surface inoculated with approximate 1 % diluted culture cocktail Listeria monocytogenes to get a target level approximately 2 log CFUgram of final product per package, rest for attached time, vacuum-packaged and stored at 4C for up to 120 days. 2.3.3 Microbiological analyses Triplicate samples of each treatment were analyzed at appropriate intervals. Each sample was opened and sterile diluent (8.5% ww sodium chloride and 0.1% wv bacteriological peptone) added in a ratio of 1:3 (meat:diluent) and homogenized for 60 sec. (Stomacher 400 Lab Blender, Seward Medical, London, England). Additional dilutions were also made in the same sterile diluent. A 50 p1 portion of the appropriate dilution for each sample was plated onto Palcam and TSA agar (Oxoid) using a spiral plater (Eddyjet type 1.23, IUL Instruments, Barcelona, Spain). Page 5 of 9 Innovation Center Food Confidential - Not intended for customers p u ra c Plates were incubated for 48h at 37 0C for Palcam and 48h at 30 0C for TSA Colonies were counted using an automatic colony counter (Colyte Supercount, Synoptics, Cambridge, UK) and with the associated software package. 3. Results and Discussion Levels of propionate in finished meat products are as follows: Use level of 0.3% Protect SR 50 = 0.3% x 50%= 0.15% Use level of 0.6% Protect SR 50 = 0.6% x 50%= 0.30% Use level of 1.0 00 Protect SR 50 = 1.0% x 50%= 0.50% Note: Protect SR 50 contains 50% sodium propionate solids 3.1 Measurements batches Table 2: measurements of the batches.

In reference to the Control, the batches with Opti.Form PD4 showed lower water activity compared to the Protect SR50 batches. This is because Opti.Form PD4 contains a high level of lactate solids (54%) and is used at a high level (3.5%). High(er) water activity has a significant effect on the growth of spoilage bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria. It is expected that the replacement of Opti.Form PD4 with Protect SR 50 will decrease the shelf life of the finished meat product. pH In reference to the Control, all batches decrease the product pH. Between the batches with 1.75% Opti.Form PD4 vs. 0.6% Protect SR50 and 3.5% Opti.Form PD4 vs. 1.0% Protect SR50 small differences in pH was observed but this was not significant. In this test there were no significant differences in cook yield between the batches.

In this test 0.6% Protect SR50 and 1.75% Opti.Form PD4 were able to control the outgrowth of Listeria monocytogenes to 1 log for 45 days. Total suppression of LM growth was observed for 120 days using 1.01% Protect SR 50 or 3.5% Opti.Form PD4. 4. Conclusions The objective of this test was to determine the suitability (pH, sensory and LM control) of Protect SR 50 on Listeria monocytogenes (max 1 log outgrowth for 90-120 days) in a beef-pork Hot dog. The results indicate suitability for all attributes measured. Page 8 of 9 Innovation Center Food Confidential - Not intended for customers PUI-ac A dosage level of 1.0% Protect SR50 did control Listeria monocytogenes for 120 days. Replacement of Opti.Form PD4 with Protect SR50 at 1% may have an impact on taste. 5. Recommendations To verify appropriate levels of Protect SR50 are being used based on customer specific product parameters (pH, salt, water activity etc), customer LM validation trials are recommended. In addition, spoilage data should be collected on customer specific formulations as well. Replacement of Opti.Form PD4 with Protect SR 50 will increase the water activity of the product due to a decrease in the level of solids being added. This is an import parameter for controlling shelf life especially lactic acid bacteria. It is expected that the replacement of Opti.Form PD4 with Protect SR 50 will decrease the shelf life of the finished meat product. The Listeria monocytogenes strains in this test and cultivation methods may vary from those used by processors and external lab companies. In this test we used a cocktail of 4 different serotypes. Some external industry Listeria monocytogenes inoculation studies using only 1 serotype. But the standard protocol showed a cocktail should at least include strains of serotypes 12a, 12b and 4b (NACMCF, 2009). Counts SR50.xlsx Page 9 of 9 Purac Protect SR50 Sodium propionate 16 , Benefits Listeria control Increase food safety For economy brands The Protect product line consists of chemical based single ingredients which can be used by processors to increase the level of food safety in their finished products. Protect SR50 is based on chemical sodium propionate, the neutralized sodium salt of propionic acid. Propionic acid is an organic acid found in Swiss cheese and is highly efficacy against Listeria and other pathogens. Targeted use Protect SR50 is targeted towards use in highly flavored low moisture meat products. such as chorizo, pepperoni and hot dogs. Intended use level is 1%. Listeria and pathogen control Meat, poultry and fish products are highly susceptible to microbiological contamination, including food-borne pathogens. Listeria monocytogenes is a major concern for food regulators and meat processors because it is able to grow at refrigerated temperatures and in products with low water activity. While Listeria is inactivated at high temperatures, it can often (re)enter the food supply following heat-treatment. Protect SR50 inhibits the bacteria's growth throughout the product's shelf life and the manufacturers supply chain, ensuring consumer safety and protecting brand image. Regulatory As of April 2011 the FSIS has not formally approved the use of propionate in USDA meat products. The rulemaking process is underway however, and manufacturers are able to request waivers from the FSIS thru Purac in order to use this product or Purac's propionate containing blends. Please speak with your Purac sales representative if you are interested in commercializing a product containing propionate.

These levels were identified using an internal Purac Listeria control model. 2.4 Analyses Hot Dogs pH The pH was measured in triplicate using flat membrane electrode. The pH of the samples was measured by cutting off 3 slices (2-3 cm thick) from the sausage and after this on the surface of the slices the pH was measured. Water activity The water activity of the cooked Hotdogs was determined using a Lab-Master-aw (Novasina, Switzerland) by placing approximately 5g portions of a meat slice into a plastic sample cup and inserted into the vapor chamber. Before the start of measurements a calibration cup of 0.98 was placed in order to check accuracy. Moisture and fat analyses Analyzed batches were Control, 3.5% Opti.Form PD4 and 1.1 00 Opti.Form Pro P24. Target moisture was 60%. Analyses performed by AL control Laboratories located in Oosterhout (Netherlands). Not all batches were analyzed due to expense Sensory evaluation A descriptive comparison taste test was done with our internal trained sensory panel. In this taste session we compared 0.9% Opti.Form Pro P24, 3.0% Opti.Form PD4, 1.1 00 Opti.Form Pro P24 and 3.5% Opti.Form PD4. Page 4 of 10 Innovation Center Food Confidential - Not intended for customers purac The Hotdogs were pre-warmed and kept warm under aluminum foil until taste session was started. Batches tested on attributes salt, meat, bitter, sweet, sour and product properties firmness, juiciness. We also asked the panel to give their preference. Microbiological evaluation 2.3.1 Preparation of inocula 5 Listeria monocyrtogenes strains (limon 23-NCTC12480-serotype 4b, limon 32- NCIMB13449-serotype 12a, limon 39-LMG23193-serotype 12a, limon 43- NRRLB33028-serotype 12b) and limon 49-NRRLB33039-serotype 12c) were singly activated in BHI broth (24h at 37 0C) from frozen glycerol stock cultures. Activated working cultures were transferred again into BHI broth and incubated for 5d at 70C. After the cultures were grown separately, a cocktail of these 5 cultures was made and diluted into 0.1% peptone water to yield desired target level inoculation of 4 logs CFUg. 2.3.2 Product inoculation After storage each sausage was disinfected with ethanol (70%), before the casing was removed. The sausages were sliced into slices on a disinfected slicer (Berkel, model 824 DeLeede the Netherlands) in a laminar flow cabinet. Slices (n=4, in total 20 grampackage) from each batch of cooked sausage were placed in individual vacuum bags, surface inoculated with approximate 1 % diluted culture cocktail Listeria monocytogenes to get a target level approximately 2 log CFUgram of final product per package, rest for attached time, vacuum-packaged and stored at 4 0C for up to 120 days. 2.3.3 Microbiological analyses Triplicate samples of each treatment were analyzed at appropriate intervals. Each sample was opened and sterile diluent (8.5% ww sodium chloride and 0.1% wv bacteriological peptone) added in a ratio of 1:3 (meat:diluent) and homogenized for 60 s (Stomacher 400 Lab Blender, Seward Medical, London, England). Additional dilutions were also made in the same sterile diluent. A 50 pl portion of the appropriate dilution for each sample was plated onto Palcam and TSA agar (Oxoid) using a spiral plater (Eddyjet type 1.23, IUL Instruments, Barcelona, Spain). Page 5 of 10 Innovation Center Food Confidential - Not intended for customers purac Plates were incubated for 48h at 37C for Palcam and 48h at 30 C for TSA Colonies were counted using an automatic colony counter (Colyte Supercount, Synoptics, Cambridge, UK) and with the associated software package. 3.

In reference to the Control, the batches with Opti.Form PD4 showed lower water activity compared to the Opti.Form Pro P24 batches. This is because Opti.Form PD4 contains a high level of lactate solids (54%) and is used at a high level (3.5%). High(er) water activity has a significant effect on the growth of Page 6 of 10 5.0 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 1.1 II U.

The batches with Opti.Form Pro P24 showed the most decrease in pH compared with the batches Opti.Form PD4, however in this test there were no significant differences in cook yield between the batches. 3.2. Sensory evaluation Taste evaluation of the Hot Dogs was done using a trained sensory panel. Results of the taste test can be found in Figure 1 and 2. Between the batches 3.0% Opti.Form PD4 and 0.9% Opti.Form Pro P24, no significant differences were found between the attributes measured. A statistically non-significant result was observed in the sample with 0.9% Opti.Form Pro 24 indicating a higher sweet score then the PD4. Figure 1: Average taste score 3.0% Opti.Form PD4 and 0.9% Opti.Form Pro P24 in Hotdogs Between the batches 3.5% Opti.Form PD4 and 1.1% Opti.Form Pro P24, significant differences were found in sweetness and meat taste (Table 3). 1.1% Opti.Form Pro P24 Page 7 of 10 5.0 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0  .  .  .     . 3.5% Opti.Form PD4 1.1% Opti.Form Pro P24 cese4' tz,4' Z7 N.'s'  &% Innovation Center Food Confidential - Not intended for customers purac was scored higher in sweetness and also reduced the meat taste compared 3.5% Opti.Form PD4. This can be explained due to the contribution of sweet notes often seen with the use of sodium propionate.

In this test 0.9% Opti.Form Pro P24 or 3.0% Opti.Form PD4 both controlled the outgrowth of Listeria monocytogenes to 1 log for 90 days. Total suppression of LM growth was observed for 120 days using 1.1% Opti.Form Pro P24 or 3.5% Opti.Form PD4. 4. Conclusions The objective of this test was to determine the suitability (pH, sensory and LM control) of Opti.Form Pro24 on Listeria monocytogenes (max 1 log outgrowth for 90-120 days) in a beef-pork Hot dog. The results indicate suitability for all attributes measured. A dosage level of 0.9% Opti.Form Pro P24 did control in this test Listeria monocytogenes for 90 days. Page 9 of 10 Innovation Center Food Confidential - Not intended for customers purac A dosage level of 1.1% Opti.Form Pro P24 did control in this test Listeria monocytogenes for 120 days. Replacement of Opti.Form PD4 with Opti.Form Pro P24 at higher levels may have a minor impact on taste. 5. Recommendations To verify appropriate levels of Opti.Form Pro P24 are being used based on customer specific product parameters (pH, salt, water activity etc), customer LM validation trials are recommended. In addition, spoilage data should be collected on customer specific formulations as well. Replacement of Opti.Form PD4 with Opti.Form Pro P24 will increase the water activity of the product due to a decrease in the level of solids being added. This is an import parameter for controlling shelf life especially lactic acid bacteria. It is expected that the replacement of Opti.Form PD4 with Opti.Form Pro P24 will decrease the shelf life of the finished meat product. The Listeria monocytogenes strains in this test and cultivation methods may vary from those used by processors and external lab companies. In this test we used a cocktail of 4 different serotypes. Some external industry Listeria monocytogenes inoculation studies using only 1 serotype. But the standard protocol showed a cocktail should at least include strains of serotypes 12a, 12b and 4b (NACMCF, 2009). iScit Counts Pro P24.xlsx Page 10 of 10 4 purac ; nature Op,Form - Pro P24 Low inclusion technology for Listeria control in RTE meat products Benefits Listeria control Increased food safety Low use level ow cost in use Safety Shelf Life Opti.Form Pro P24 A liquid blend of potassium acetate and sodium propionate Based on propionic acid, the same acid found in swiss cheese and acetic acid Part of the Opti.Form line of products- the gold standard in LM protection of RTE meat products Opti.Form Pro is a new brand of products and includes blends containing Propionate Highly effective Use levels up to 1.2% Labeling: potassium acetate, sodium propionate Intended use level is 0.8-1.2%. Targeted use Cured and uncured, flavorful value based cooked meat products with low moisture contents. Listeria and pathogen control Listeria monocytogenes is a major concern because it is able to grow at refrigerated temperatures and in products with low water activity. While Listeria is inactivated at high temperatures, it can often (re)enter the food supply following heat-treatment. Opti.Form inhibits the bacteria's growth throughout the product's shelf life and the manufacturers supply chain, ensuring consumer safety and protecting brand image. Regulatory On May 72012, the FSIS published a proposed rule in the Federal Register indicating their intention to allow the use of propionates in meat products. We expect a final determination in 2012 and until that time, the use of propionate containing ingredients may continue to be used via a waiver.
